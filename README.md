# DAMONTE-Python-Portfolio

<h3> My Python Portfolio 😇 
This respositpry will contain my Python Portfolio for the work that I acomplish in Elements of Computing 2 during the spring semester my junior year. I am hoping to sucessfully demonstraight my skills in python inclduing programing, data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. I will focus in a food theme in order to give my portfolio some consistncy and <em>flavor</em> 🥰


## Portfolio Structure 🍔🌭🌮🌯🥙🥗🍝🧁🍰🍭🥥🥩🍘
I plan on using data to understand the best foods for each age group as well as create wasy and delicous recepies along the way. I hope to understand consumer behavior based on age group and range of family size as well as the break down of certain food compoistion and their nutrional facts. 

I plan to organize my portfolio as follows:

- **EDA📊**: Folder for all my Exploratory Data Analysis projects, where I explore and clean datasets. I hope to explore to uncover hidden insights from food datasets, suhc as identifying correlations between food ingridients and nutrional values, and understanding regional consumption trends. 
- **Visualizations👀**: Folder for projects focusing on data visualization using libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `plotly`. I will visualize key aspects of food data like the distribution of calories in different food categories, or compare allergen content across various products, making the data more accessible and easier to interpret for decision-making.
- **Models🥒**: Folder for machine learning models, including both supervised and unsupervised learning. As well as apply machine learning models to predict factors like shelf life, consumer preferences, or the likelihood of foodborne illness outbreaks based on historical data and current trends.
- **Notebooks📓**: Folder for Jupyter Notebooks containing step-by-step code explanations and project walkthroughs while also using Jupyter Notebooks to combine code, visualizations, and markdown to explain your findings clearly, making it easier for others to understand the methodology and replicate the analysis in their own projects.

## Future Additions

- I will continue to add projects as I work through more advanced topics like deep learning, NLP, and time series analysis.
- My projects will be regularly updated with new techniques, optimizations, and analysis.
- I also plan to create folders as well as use graphs to visualize my data more efficiently. Some of these graphs could be scatter plats or bot plots.
