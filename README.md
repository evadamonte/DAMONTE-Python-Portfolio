# DAMONTE-Python-Portfolio

<h3> My Python Portfolio ðŸ˜‡ 3</h3>
This respositpry will contain my Python Portfolio for the work that I acomplish in Elements of Computing 2 during the spring semester my junior year. I am hoping to sucessfully demonstraight my skills in python inclduing programing, data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. I will focus in a food theme in order to give my portfolio some consistncy and flavor ðŸ¥°


## Portfolio Structure

I plan to organize my portfolio as follows:

- **EDA**: Folder for all my Exploratory Data Analysis projects, where I explore and clean datasets.
- **Visualizations**: Folder for projects focusing on data visualization using libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `plotly`.
- **Models**: Folder for machine learning models, including both supervised and unsupervised learning.
- **Notebooks**: Folder for Jupyter Notebooks containing step-by-step code explanations and project walkthroughs.

## Future Additions

- I will continue to add projects as I work through more advanced topics like deep learning, NLP, and time series analysis.
- My projects will be regularly updated with new techniques, optimizations, and analysis.
