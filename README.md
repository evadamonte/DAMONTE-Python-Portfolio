# 🐍 Python Portfolio – Eva Diana Damonte

Welcome to my Python project portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of interactive and data-driven apps built using Streamlit, pandas, spaCy, and more. Each project reflects a blend of my academic work and personal interests, developed as part of my Computing 2 course at the University of Notre Dame with Professor David Smiley.

### 3. 🧼🫧 Tidy Data Project
A deep dive into cleaning and reshaping Olympic medalist data using tidy data principles.

**Project Summary:**
Using the 2008 Olympic dataset, I cleaned missing values and transformed the dataset from wide to long format. I separated key variables like gender, sport, and medal type to produce a structured dataset ready for analysis. The final notebook includes multiple visualizations highlighting trends across disciplines.
